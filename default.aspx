       <h3>Old Trafford set for Bayern clash</h3> 

  <p>Electric atmospheres of the past are set to be rivalled at Old Trafford on Tuesday evening when the Manchester United faithful join the team on a mission to beat Bayern Munich in the Champions League quarter-final.</p>

<p>European nights have a legendary reputation at the Theatre of Dreams, with their colour, noise and almost tangible emotions creating an environment that can drive the Reds to victory and live forever in the memories of the participants, from the players on the pitch to the supporters in the stands.</p>

<p>The stage will be set with a special crowd mosaic on three sides of the ground greeting the two teams as they emerge from the tunnel – the word ‘United’ will be emblazoned across the lower tier of the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand with the club’s iconic devil motif flanking this left and right in the West and East Stands.</p>

<p>Fans who are fortune enough to be attending the big match against Bayern are asked to take their seats and either help create the mosaic or view it in all its glory. In short, it’s show your support time again. Make no mistake, it makes a difference, as the players themselves are proud to declare. </p>
