    <h2> Man U 1-Bayern Munich</h2>
    <h3>Moyes: We can go through</h3>


<p>David Moyes was delighted with Manchester United's performance against Bayern Munich in the Champions League on Tuesday night, and believes his side can go on to reach the semi-final.</p>

<p>The Reds held the current European champions to a 1-1 draw at Old Trafford, after a Bastian Schweinsteiger strike cancelled out Nemanja Vidic's opener, leaving the tie finely poised ahead of next week's second leg.</p>

<p>After the game, Moyes acknowledged the challenge ahead but praised the contribution of both the players and fans, factors which he thinks have given United a chance of qualification.</p>

<p>"We know that we need to score a goal [in the second leg]," said the manager. "At the minute, if the score stays the same, Bayern will go through. We have to do something about it, but I said tonight that we wanted to go into the second leg with a real chance, and I think we've done that. We've given ourselves a great opportunity to go to Munich and get a victory.</p>

<p>"The players played really well tonight, so we're delighted with the performance. I was a bit disappointed that we conceded a goal in the end, but I thought it was a really good performance. The fans were great tonight, there was a great atmosphere inside the ground, but I'm really pleased with how the players played."</p>
